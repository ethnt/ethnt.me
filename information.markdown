I'm a student at [Marist College](http://marist.edu) pursuing a degree in computer science with a focus on software development, as well as minors in graphic design, information systems, and information technology. Particularly, I've focused on web development and programming languages.

I'm also a web developer that works primarily with Ruby, JavaScript, and occasionally Haskell and Elixir. Iâ€™ve been working in the web field for seven years, and I'm currently a web developer at [Oak](https://oak.is), where I work on [Siteleaf](https://siteleaf.com/). Previously, I was the Chief Information Officer for the [Marist College Student Government Association](http://sga.marist.edu) and a web developer at [Fanzter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanzter).

Hi, my name’s Ethan, and I’m a software developer. I use Ruby, JavaScript, and occasionally Haskell to make mostly web applications. I’ve been in the web field for six years, and I’m currently a web developer at [Oak](https://oak.is), where I work on [Siteleaf](https://siteleaf.com). Previously, I was a web developer at [Fanzter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanzer).

Right now I’m also working on improving the way we plan and organize our travel with [Rover](http://gorover.co). In the past, I’ve worked on projects with the [Marist College Student Government Association](http://sga.marist.edu) and other organizations.

I’m available for freelance work! If you need help on a web project, [drop me a line](mailto:ethan@ethnt.me).

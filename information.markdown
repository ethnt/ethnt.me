I'm a software developer using Ruby, JavaScript, and occasionally Haskell to make web products. I've been in the web field for six years, and I'm currently a software engineer [Aircall](https://aircall.io/). Previously, I was a full-stack developer at [Oak](https://oak.is) (working on [Siteleaf](https://siteleaf.com) and [CreativeMornings](https://creativemornings)) and a web developer at [Fanzter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanzter).

In the past, I’ve worked on projects with the [Marist College Student Government Association](http://sga.marist.edu), and I’ve freelanced for clients in housing, travel, and other industries.

I'm currently <span class="js-availability"></span>.

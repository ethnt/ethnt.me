I’m not good at keeping up a blog. I’ve had dozens over the years in various places (Posterous, Wordpress, Tumblr, you name it), and hopefully this sticks.

I’m going to be writing about Ruby, design, infrastructure, and anything else really. But I don’t expect people to actually _read_ this. You see, this is for me, not you.

Anyways, we’ll see what happens. It’ll probably be gone in six months anyways.

[_Racked_ took a look at _Kinfolk_](http://www.racked.com/2016/3/14/11173148/kinfolk-lifestyle-magazines), the latest in a long line of lifestyle magazines that have spawned a media empire. Like _Monocle_ before it, _Kinfolk_ represents a particular aesthetic and lifestyle that many (especially young people) aspire to.

> A lifestyle is made up of a shared vernacular. My Instagram was so popular because my friends recognized a quiet coffee in a foreign city as a badge of the lifestyle that we aspire to. Perhaps these days we demonstrate our mutual recognition by exchanging likes rather than buying magazine subscriptions. Aspiration is mediated by digital technology rather than print. We model our lifestyle goals in Instagram photos because the medium is so accessible. We can publicly participate in our chosen lifestyles all the time, constantly signaling our belonging and getting affirmation in return, creating our own communities rather than waiting for the directions of an editor.

> This is ultimately why Kinfolk worked so well. It created a lifestyle with familiar, do-it-yourself tokens — the unfinished wood tables and mason jars and dinner parties — fit for a world in recession, and subsumed them within an iconic visual style that was equally easy to participate in through social media. Kinfolk also came into existence just as we started using platforms like Instagram aspirationally, translating the aesthetics of the glossy print page onto the even glossier screen and making them our own in the process. As Williams admits, he lost control of what "Kinfolk" communicated. It means more to people as a label than as a substantive movement or even a magazine.

As a young person who is on the fringes of a creative field, it’s very easy for _Kinfolk_ to appeal to me. It also is very easy for me to be repulsed by it — the sort of exclusivity that the brand exudes is something that makes me uncomfortable.
